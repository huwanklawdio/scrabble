// ================================
// Game Logic Export Index
// ================================

// This file will export all game logic modules once they are implemented
// Currently empty - game logic will be added in subsequent tasks

// Export game types that are already defined
export type {
  GameState,
  Player,
  Tile,
  Move,
  BoardCell,
  BoardPosition,
  GamePhase,
} from '../types';

// TODO: Add game logic exports as they are implemented:
// export { default as GameEngine } from './engine/GameEngine';
// export { default as GameState } from './state/GameState';
// export { default as MoveValidator } from './rules/MoveValidator';
// export { default as ScoreCalculator } from './rules/ScoreCalculator';
// export { default as BoardManager } from './board/BoardManager';
// export { default as PlayerManager } from './players/PlayerManager';
